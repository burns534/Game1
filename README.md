# Terrain-generation
OpenGL terrain generation and hydraulic erosion simulation using OpenGL 3.3.

This was my first major graphics project with OpenGL. It began with generating a terrain mesh using my own custom Perlin noise implementation, and progressed to feature Phong lighting, animated water, and shadows. I'm currently attempting to achieve hydraulic erosion simulation on the generated terrain.
